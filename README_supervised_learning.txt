# Supervised Learning (Regression Models) - README

## Description:
This section trains and evaluates multiple regression models on the visitor arrivals dataset:
- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Lasso Regression
- Random Forest Regression
- Support Vector Regression (SVR)

## Dependencies:
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy

## How to Run:
1. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy
   ```
2. Run the script `supervised_learning.py` to train the regression models and evaluate their performance.
3. The script will display performance metrics such as MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R² for each model.

## Steps:
1. **Model Training**: Train multiple regression models using the visitor arrivals data.
2. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the models using metrics like MAE (Mean Absolute Error), MSE (Mean Squared Error), R² (Coefficient of Determination).
3. **Comparison**: Compare the performance of different models and select the best-performing one.
